    <h1>Pentathlon Toolbox</h1>
    <p>This site is to become a collection of tools pertaining to the sport of modern pentathlon. For now it just has a timing tool to aid in the running of laser run events.</p>
    <h2>Pentathlon Timer</h2>
    <p>This timer can be setup and used in 3 easy steps:</p>
    <h3>1. Race Setup</h3>
    <p>Enter each athlete's number, name (optional) and the number of laps they are completing, either manually entering or from a csv file.</p>
    <h3>2. Race Timing</h3>
    <p>Each time an athlete completes a lap, hit the button representing them (or the blank lap button and add number later).</p>
    <h3>3. View and export Results</h3>
    <p>Results are available as a raw csv of times, as a vieable table, or as an xlsx file download. Note that results are only stored locally - that means that only you can view them on the site and need to share them on some other platform for competitors to view.</p>
    <button type="button" onclick="window.location.href='racesetup.html'">Setup a Race</button>
